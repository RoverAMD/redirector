This is a simple redirect pages generator that I made.

= Usage
Create a so-called "sitemap" file containing all the redirects in the following format:

[source]
----
[alias] > [destination]
----

Example:

[source]
----
example > http://example.com
foo -> /bar.html
----

Save it to a plain text file, then run ``sitemap.tcl`` via ``tclsh`` with the name of the file as its only argument.

This will create all the necessary directories in pwd with redirector htmls.
